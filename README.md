# Finding the Best Car Value - Microsoft Excel Project :car:

In my Spring 2022 semester, I completed a project in my Intermediate Business Statistics course (MAS202) in which I used Microsoft Excel to analyze a dataset that contains information for 20 family sedans, including price, cost-per-mile, road-test scores, and predicted reliability. _Consumer Reports_ developed what is known as a value score, which takes these predictor variables into account to determine the value of a given car. Through calculating the descriptive statistics, p-values, t-statistics, and R-squares of each variable, we discovered that price and cost-per-mile had the most influence over value and should be included in building a new model for finding value scores.
